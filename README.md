**GPIO Pins**: All standard GPIO pins are available for additional sensors, actuators, or indicators if needed for extended functionality.

### Dual Device Setup

**Device Identification**: Each ESP32 device has a unique MAC address that serves as its identifier in the ESP-NOW network. The project code includes provisions for configuring peer MAC addresses for targeted communication.

**Physical Separation**: For optimal testing, place the two ESP32 devices at least 1 meter apart initially, then test at various distances up to the maximum 200-meter range to verify communication reliability.

**Power Supply Considerations**: Both devices can be powered via USB during development, or through external batteries for mobile applications and range testing.

### MAC Address Configuration

Before deployment, you must configure the MAC addresses in both transmitter and receiver code to establish proper peer-to-peer communication.

**Finding MAC Address**: Use the WiFi.macAddress() function or check device labels to identify each ESP32's unique MAC address.

**Code Configuration**: Update the broadcastAddress array in both transmitter.ino and receiver.ino files with the corresponding peer device MAC addresses.

## 💻 Software Configuration & Programming

### Code Customization

**MAC Address Setup**: The most critical configuration step involves setting up the correct MAC addresses for peer communication. Each device needs to know the MAC address of its communication partner.

In transmitter.ino:
```cpp
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0x8C, 0x4F, 0x00, 0x2F, 0xAD, 0x94}; // Replace with receiver's MAC
```

In receiver.ino:
```cpp
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0x8C, 0x4F, 0x00, 0x2F, 0xAD, 0x94}; // Replace with transmitter's MAC
```

**Message Structure Customization**: The default implementation uses a simple string message structure, but this can be expanded to include additional data types such as sensor readings, control commands, or structured data packets.

**Communication Channel**: The code uses channel 0 (auto-select) for communication. This can be modified to use specific WiFi channels (1-14) for environments with multiple ESP-NOW networks.

**Encryption Settings**: The current implementation uses unencrypted communication for simplicity. For security-critical applications, enable encryption by setting `peerInfo.encrypt = true` and configuring appropriate encryption keys.

### Programming Procedure

**Board Selection**: In Arduino IDE, select the correct ESP32 board type from Tools -> Board menu. For ESP32-WROOM-32, select "ESP32 Dev Module" or "NodeMCU-32S" depending on your specific development board.

**Port Configuration**: Select the correct COM port for each device from Tools -> Port menu. Each ESP32 will appear as a separate serial port when connected via USB.
